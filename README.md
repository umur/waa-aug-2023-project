## Alumni Management Portal
 
The Alumni Management System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to efficiently organize and manage the interactions and data of a university or educational institution's alumni network. The primary goal of this project is to create a user-friendly platform that fosters stronger connections between alumni, facilitates networking opportunities, and enables seamless communication between alumni and the institution.
